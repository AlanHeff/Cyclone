To generate strings, load a saved DFA (Enter 'L' in main menu then enter DFA file number).
at Generate strings type 'Y' then enter length of string to be generated and number of strings.
it will tell you the shortest string acceptable by the DFA by typing 'S' at "Generate String".

You can then test the strings generated by Typing 'Y' at "test strings?" and copy and pasting them
in or write in your own strings. exit test mode with '_b'

Can create new DFAs also (up to 9) 'C' in main menu and follow instructions and delete 'D' 
then 'Q' to end program
